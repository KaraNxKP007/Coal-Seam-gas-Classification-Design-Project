# Innovative Water Treatment for Coal Seam Gas

## Project Overview
This project explores sustainable solutions for managing Coal Seam Gas (CSG) produced water using advanced membrane technologies. The focus is on pollutant removal, brine volume reduction, and Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) systems to enhance water recovery and reduce environmental impact. Innovative ceramic microfiltration membranes made from coal fly ash are also utilized, providing cost-effective and energy-efficient wastewater treatment solutions.

## Features
- **Advanced Filtration Techniques**: Utilizes Reverse Osmosis (RO), Nanofiltration, and Ultrafiltration for CSG produced water.
- **Innovative Membrane Development**: Ceramic microfiltration membranes prepared from coal fly ash using slip casting.
- **Sustainable Water Recovery**: High-efficiency water recovery and pollutant removal with minimal chemical usage.
- **Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD)**: Ensures no wastewater discharge, minimizing environmental impact.
